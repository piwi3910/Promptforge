## **Elevator Pitch**

A centralized prompt management platform that transforms scattered AI prompts into an organized, searchable, and shareable knowledge base \- think "GitHub for prompts" where users can version, collaborate, and monetize their best AI interactions.

## **Problem Statement**

AI users repeatedly lose valuable prompts across multiple platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney, etc.), struggle to find and reuse their best work, and lack ways to collaborate or learn from others' proven prompts. This leads to duplicated effort, inconsistent results, and missed opportunities for knowledge sharing.

## **Target Audience**

* **Primary**: Power users of AI tools (developers, content creators, researchers) who use prompts daily  
* **Secondary**: Teams collaborating on AI projects who need standardized prompts  
* **Tertiary**: Prompt engineers looking to monetize their expertise

## **USP**

Unlike simple note-taking apps or platform-specific histories, we provide a dedicated prompt management system with version control, advanced formatting support (Markdown/XML), collaboration features, and cross-platform compatibility \- making prompts as manageable as code.

## **Target Platforms**

* Web application (responsive design)  
* Browser extension for quick capture
